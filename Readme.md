**CSV not opening correctly in Excel**

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- **Smaller date ranges** export faster and are more reliable
- **Keep Discord tab active** during export to prevent interruptions  
- **Close other Discord tabs** to avoid potential conflicts
- **Stable internet connection** prevents timeouts

- **No data collection**: This extension doesn't collect or transmit your data anywhere
- **Open source**: All code is available for review

## üìù Limitations

- **User tokens only**: Currently supports user tokens (against Discord ToS)
- **Text channels**: Optimized for server text channels
- **Chrome only**: Designed for Chrome/Chromium browsers
